# Dynamic-Stack
Dynamic implementation of a stack ADT in C. There is an example program used for testing that randomly pushes and pops off the stack.


Usage
======

```bash
$ make  # compiles stack.c and test program 
$ ./stack # to execute
``` 

# Notes
This implementation pushes onto the end of the array. When the capacity is reached the array is resized.
